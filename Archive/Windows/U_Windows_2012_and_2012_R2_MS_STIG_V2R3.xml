If password complexity software that enforces a case-sensitive character mix of at least one of each of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters is not installed, this is a finding.

The enpasflt password filter is available as an option on the IASE website in the Windows Support Files area (PKI required - http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/os/windows/support_files.html).  It must be tested for the particular environment.  If it does not function properly or causes issues, the site will be responsible for obtaining other password complexity software to meet the requirements.

The current available versions are:

Name - Modified Date
EnPasFltV2x86.dll - 3/21/2011
EnPasFltV2x64.dll - 3/21/2011

If another product, such as PPE, or a different version of enpasflt is used, the SA must demonstrate that it is configured to enforce the DoD requirements.

For the enpasflt password filter to function properly, verify the following:

-The appropriate version of the file will be located in %systemroot%\system32.
-The Date Modified should be 3/21/2011.
-The "Notification Packages" value under registry key "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA" must include the file name (e.g., "EnPasFltV2x86").

Note: If a password filter is not used, the site is still responsible for requiring full compliance with DoD policy, even though the password complexity setting does not enforce the 4-character type rule.</rawString>

Verify the operating system employs a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy to allow the execution of authorized software programs.

If an application whitelisting program is not in use on the system, this is a finding.

Configuration of whitelisting applications will vary by the program.

AppLocker is a whitelisting application built into Windows Server 2012.

If AppLocker is used, perform the following to view the configuration of AppLocker:
Open PowerShell.

If the AppLocker PowerShell module has not been previously imported, execute the following first:
Import-Module AppLocker

Execute the following command, substituting [c:\temp\file.xml] with a location and file name appropriate for the system:
Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective | Set-Content ('c:\temp\file.xml')

This will produce an xml file with the effective settings that can be viewed in a browser or opened in a program such as Excel for review.

Implementation guidance for AppLocker is available in the NSA paper "Application Whitelisting using Microsoft AppLocker" under the Microsoft Windows section of the following link:

      <rawString>This requirement is NA for non domain-joined systems.

*This requirement may be satisfied by the existence of the new built-in security groups "Local account" or "Local account and member of Administrators group".

Execute the following PowerShell commands to determine if the new built-in security groups exist on the system:

$SID = New-Object System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier ("S-1-5-113")
$Account = $SID.Translate([System.Security.Principal.NTAccount])
$Account.Value

If the group exists, "NT Authority\Local account" will be returned.
(Using SID S-1-5-114 will return "NT Authority\Local account and member of Administrators group".)

If the built-in groups exist, this is not a finding.

If the built-in groups do not exist on the system, review local groups defined on the system.

Documentation and scripts supporting the creation of this group to restrict local administrative accounts were changed at one point.  The original name, "DeniedNetworkAccess", was changed to "DenyNetworkAccess".  Automated benchmarks will look for either of these groups.

If the group "DenyNetworkAccess" or "DeniedNetworkAccess" does not exist, this is a finding.

Compare the membership of the defined group with the local Administrators group.
Verify the group includes all local administrator accounts as members.
This includes the built-in Administrator account.  It does not include domain administrative accounts or groups.

If the group "DenyNetworkAccess" or "DeniedNetworkAccess" does not include all local administrator accounts, this is a finding.

*Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 added new built-in security groups, "Local account" and "Local account and member of Administrators group", for assigning permissions and rights to local accounts. 
Microsoft Security Advisory Patch 2871997 adds these groups to Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows Server 2008 R2, and Windows Server 2012.
Use these groups instead of creating a group for local administrator accounts to apply to deny rights where required.  Assign the group "Local account and member of Administrators group" or the more restrictive "Local account".

Automated benchmarks will look for the groups referenced in the requirement.  Use of other methods will require manual validation.</rawString>
